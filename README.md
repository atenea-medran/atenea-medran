## Learnings of these months coding:
- Program small functioning pieces to avoid errors.
- 5 simple lines of code are better than a huge one.
- Comments are here to help our future self and our colleages understand our code.
- Write everything in english from the beginning and all the dataframe columns with underscore.
- Lowercase and no accents are key to standarize data, specially in other languages.
- Prepare an scheme before coding. A piece of paper can be a good option.
- A print() in the correct spot inside a function can help you find the data that is making your code fail.
- Be sure of what you have, what the function is asking and what it is giving back. The understanding of the different data types is fundamental.
