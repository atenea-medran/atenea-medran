# My Projects
* **[Web app to visualize the price of the kWh in Spain made with Ktor (Kotlin)](https://historicoprecioluz.es)**: I made the backend with Ktor, a Kotlin Framework. As database I used MySQL. I populated the database with a Python script. The frontend is made with Freemarker, a Ktor plugin, although I almost didn't made anything. It is not finish because I am studying more important things right now.
* **[Resizing images](My%20Projects/resize_images.ipynb)**: a small script to resize images in order to save space in the SSD. I converted 6 GB of photos into 100 MB, maintaining a good quality.
* **[Telegram bot to download multiple images](My%20Projects/telegram_bot_to_download_multiple_images.ipynb)**: the Telegram Android app doesn't have the option to download multiple images, just one by one. It is only available in Telegram Desktop. I made this as a Python exercise. I will finish it in the future, I am studying more important things right now.
* **[How to analyze twitter](https://github.com/atenea-medran/how-to-analyze-twitter)**: A serie of exercises regarding Twitter. This is my biggest project until now. It is placed in a separated repository because I have given two presentations and this way people will find the methods more easily.

* **[Twitter hashtag analysis with Python](My%20Projects/Twitter%20hashtag%20analysis%20with%20Python.ipynb)**: an analysis of hashtag #aquiestamoslasfeministas using t-hoarder, Gephi and Python. Project for the University of Granada. This is the first hashtag I analyzed. It is important because it was a real analysis and I answered several questions I made myself before the analysis.
